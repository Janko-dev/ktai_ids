# Network Intrusion Detection System
For the course Key Topics in Artificial Intelligence, we explored implementation details of several Machine Learning models, i.e., Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Random Forests (RFs), to create a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). Furthermore, the ML implementations are anomaly-based (label prediction) and signature-based (multi-class prediction) NIDS.

In this repository, we present the implementation of the models. To obtain the `UNSW-NB15`dataset, it can be downloaded from the this [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrwellsdavid/unsw-nb15). It is required to place the files `/UNSW_NB15_testing-set.csv` and `/UNSW_NB15_training-set.csv` in the `/dataset` folder.
